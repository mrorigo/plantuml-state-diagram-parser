# PlantUML State Diagram Parser

[`pest`](https://pest.rs)-based parser for PlantUML state diagrams.

*NOTE* Work in progress, this is very fragile at the moment. 

## Quick start

    # cargo run --example blinky  


## Acknowledgments

Writing PEST parsers is not my dayjob, so I used some LLMs to figure out the syntax.

ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo was less helpful than [Phind](https://phind.com), making alot of mistakes with quoting for example, while Phind got me very very far on the first try.

If you send me a PR, I will for sure consider it!
